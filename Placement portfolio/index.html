                    <div class="des">
                        <strong>Describe (D):</strong><br>
                        During my Work Integrated Learning (WIL) placement, I developed a furniture shop e-commerce
                        website using PHP, Laravel, MySQL, and custom CSS alongside Bootstrap. My primary focus was
                        ensuring the website was responsive for mobile devices while maintaining a user-friendly
                        interface. I implemented functionalities for product listing, categorization, and order
                        management, as well as creating an admin panel for the shop owner to easily manage products,
                        including adding, editing, or deleting them.
                    </div>

                    <div class="des">
                        <strong>Interpret (I):</strong><br>
                        One of the significant challenges I faced was managing the admin panel, which was a central part
                        of the project. The panel needed to provide complete control over products, categories, orders,
                        and settings, while being user-friendly. Balancing simplicity with functionality was
                        challenging, as I had to ensure smooth integration of all features. This required thorough
                        testing and several iterations to improve the overall interface.
                        <br><br>
                        Another major challenge was time management. In addition to the e-commerce project, I was tasked
                        with updating a basic website for another client and handling university assignments. Balancing
                        these responsibilities and explaining code to senior developers while managing feedback was
                        overwhelming. It taught me the importance of task prioritization and seeking help when
                        necessary.

                    <div class="des">
                        <strong>Evaluate (E):</strong><br>
                        My proficiency in Laravel, PHP, and Bootstrap allowed me to efficiently build a
                        mobile-responsive e-commerce site. However, I realized that my approach to the admin panel could
                        have been more efficient. Initially, I spent too much time perfecting individual features, which
                        delayed the overall progress and caused me to miss early feedback from senior developers.
                        <br><br>
                        When managing multiple projects, I struggled with time management. My hesitancy to seek help or
                        clarification on the smaller client website updates further stretched my time. As a result, I
                        found it challenging to balance the company’s expectations, university work, and timely delivery
                        of the e-commerce project.
                    </div>

                    <div class="des">
                        <strong>Plan (P):</strong><br>
                        To improve admin panel design in future projects, I plan to enhance my understanding of
                        user-centric backend systems by studying common design patterns for admin panels. I will also
                        improve my time management by using tools like Trello or Jira to better prioritize tasks and
                        allocate time effectively across multiple projects.
                        <br>
                        Additionally, I aim to strengthen my skills in responsive design and explore JavaScript
                        frameworks like React, which will help me manage complex frontend functionalities more
                        efficiently. In the future, I will seek feedback earlier in the process to avoid delays and
                        foster smoother collaboration.

                        <strong>Artefact 1: Building a Furniture E-commerce Platform (Technical Skills
                            Development)</strong><br><br>

                        <strong>Context:</strong><br>
                        During my WIL placement at Stegowl Technologies, I was tasked with building a mobile-responsive
                        furniture shop e-commerce platform. This project involved using PHP and the Laravel framework
                        for backend development, along with MySQL for managing the product database. I also integrated
                        custom CSS and Bootstrap to ensure the site was visually appealing and functional on both
                        desktop and mobile devices. The admin panel needed to give the shop owner full control over the
                        platform, allowing them to add, edit, and delete products, manage categories, and handle
                        customer orders.
                        <br><br>

                        <strong>Action:</strong><br>
                        I applied my existing knowledge of web development technologies like PHP, CSS, and Bootstrap to
                        create a fully functional e-commerce site. The biggest technical challenge I faced was building
                        an admin panel that would allow non-technical users to easily manage the store's inventory. I
                        had to integrate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for products and categories and
                        ensure that the owner could view and manage orders efficiently. This required implementing
                        complex backend logic while maintaining a user-friendly interface.
                        <br><br>

                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        The final product was a dynamic, mobile-responsive e-commerce website with an intuitive admin
                        panel. The project enhanced my technical skills, particularly in backend development using
                        Laravel and MySQL. I became more adept at creating user interfaces that allowed for easy

                        project also allowed me to refine my responsive design skills, ensuring that the site worked
                        seamlessly across all device sizes.
                        <br><br>

                        <strong>Learning:</strong><br>
                        Through this experience, I deepened my understanding of Laravel and MySQL, particularly in
                        handling database interactions and user authentication. I also improved my skills in creating
                        responsive and user-friendly frontends using Bootstrap. The project highlighted the importance
                        of considering the end-user experience in every aspect of development. This knowledge is
                        directly relevant to my major in Software Development, as it reinforced core principles of

                        <strong>Artefact 2: Time Management and Task Prioritization (Transferable Skills
                            Development)</strong><br><br>

                        <strong>Context:</strong><br>
                        In addition to my primary project of developing the e-commerce platform, I was tasked with
                        updating a basic website for another client at Stegowl Technologies. At the same time, I was
                        balancing university assignments and seeking feedback from senior developers on the primary
                        project. These competing demands made it clear that I needed to improve my time management and
                        prioritization skills to avoid delays and ensure that all projects were delivered on time.
                        <br><br>

                        <strong>Action:</strong><br>
                        To manage the competing priorities, I adopted a more structured approach to my tasks. I began
                        using a task management tool (Trello) to break down each project into smaller, manageable tasks.
                        I allocated specific time slots to work on the e-commerce platform, client updates, and
                        university work. Additionally, I made it a point to seek feedback early on in the process for
                        both the client project and the e-commerce site, which allowed me to address any issues before
                        they became major obstacles.
                        <br><br>

                        <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                        By using Trello to track my tasks and deadlines, I was able to meet project timelines and manage
                        my workload more effectively. This improved my ability to focus on one task at a time, while
                        still maintaining an overview of all my ongoing responsibilities. Seeking feedback early helped
                        me avoid rework, particularly in the e-commerce project, where I had initially delayed asking
                        for clarification. As a result, I was able to deliver both projects within the given time
                        frames.
                        <br><br>

                        <strong>Learning:</strong><br>
                        This experience taught me the importance of prioritization and proactive communication in
                        managing multiple projects. I now understand the value of breaking larger projects into smaller,
                        manageable tasks and allocating time accordingly. These transferable skills—time management,
                        task prioritization, and clear communication—will be invaluable in my future career, regardless
                        of the technical context. They are directly applicable to the fast-paced nature of software
                        development, where managing multiple projects and deadlines is often the norm. Moving forward, I
                        will continue to refine these skills, ensuring that I can balance technical demands with
                        organizational efficiency in my professional life.

                        <strong>Context (C):</strong><br>
                        During my time as a mentor in Griffith University's Peer Assisted Learning (PAL) program, I supported first-year IT students by offering guidance on course content and study strategies. This role required me to take on a leadership position and share my knowledge while fostering a collaborative learning environment.

                        <strong>Action (A):</strong><br>
                        I organized weekly group sessions, where I helped students with difficult topics like programming basics and web development. To ensure inclusivity and engagement, I employed various teaching methods such as interactive coding exercises and peer discussions. I also provided individual mentoring to those who needed extra help, tailoring my approach to meet their unique learning needs.

                        <strong>Result (R):</strong><br>
                        Through this experience, I developed strong leadership, communication, and teamwork skills. The students I mentored reported improved confidence in their studies and better comprehension of difficult subjects. Additionally, I gained a deeper understanding of how to break down complex concepts and explain them in a simple, effective manner.

                        This experience reinforced the importance of clear communication and adaptability in a leadership role, skills which are vital in the IT industry. It also taught me how to foster a collaborative environment where everyone feels supported. These leadership and mentorship skills will be invaluable as I pursue a career in software development, where collaboration and guidance are essential for team success.
