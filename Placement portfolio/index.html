                    <strong>Interpret (I):</strong><br>
                    Throughout my placement, I encountered a variety of frontend challenges. One significant challenge occurred when the e-commerce website struggled with mobile responsiveness. Users on smaller devices experienced distorted layouts, which hindered their browsing experience. This made me realize the importance of thoroughly testing across various devices and using responsive design techniques such as flexible grids and media queries.
                    <br><br>

                    <br><br>
                
                    <strong>Action:</strong><br>
                    To achieve this, I structured the pages using HTML and used CSS for custom styling. I utilized Bootstrap’s grid system to ensure responsiveness, allowing the website to maintain a consistent layout across different screen sizes. After understanding the client’s requirements, I designed wireframes and customized pre-built Bootstrap components like navigation bars and buttons to match the furniture shop’s branding.
                    <br><br>
                    One key task involved creating a grid format for product listings, making it easier for users to browse and select products. I used media queries to ensure the layout adapted smoothly to mobile devices. To validate my work, I tested the interface on various screen sizes, making adjustments as needed to ensure all elements, such as buttons and images, aligned properly.
                    <br><br>
                
                    <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                    The final product was a responsive, user-friendly interface that improved the website’s usability across devices. The eCommerce site’s performance on mobile devices increased significantly due to the optimized design and layout changes. The result was a polished frontend that contributed positively to the shop’s online presence and improved the customer experience.

                    <strong>Context:</strong><br>
                    In addition to the main eCommerce site, I worked on developing the admin panel for the shop owner to manage product listings and customer orders. While the backend functionality was handled by another team member using Laravel, my responsibility was to create a frontend interface that was intuitive and easy for non-technical users to navigate. My focus was on implementing dynamic elements that allowed for real-time updates without the need for full page reloads, enhancing the overall efficiency of the system.
                    <br><br>
                
                    <strong>Action:</strong><br>
                    I used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to design a simple and clean admin dashboard. The Bootstrap modals and form components were customized to make the product management process straightforward, allowing the administrator to easily add, edit, and delete products. To improve interactivity, I used JavaScript and jQuery to incorporate dynamic features such as real-time form validation. I also implemented AJAX calls to update specific sections of the admin panel, providing instant feedback without reloading the entire page.
                    <br><br>
                
                    <strong>Result:</strong><br>
                    The admin panel was functional and user-friendly, allowing the shop owner to manage products and orders efficiently. The dynamic components I implemented helped to streamline the workflow by reducing page reload times and improving responsiveness. The real-time updates provided a smoother user experience, making the admin panel more interactive and productive.
                    <br><br>
                
                    <strong>Learning:</strong><br>

                <div class="des">
                    <strong>Context (c):</strong><br>
                    During my placement at Stegowl Technologies, I encountered a situation that highlighted the importance of ethical conduct in the ICT industry, specifically around data privacy. While working on a customer data collection form for an eCommerce website, the initial draft requested an excessive amount of personal information, including details that were not necessary for the user’s shopping experience. This raised concerns about potential misuse of personal data and data privacy risks.
                </div>
            
                <div class="des">
                    <strong>Action (A):</strong><br>
                    Recognizing the ethical implications, I advocated for a more responsible approach by suggesting that we only collect the essential data needed for order processing. I recommended revising the form to align with data privacy best practices and suggested adding a clear privacy policy that explained how customer data would be used. Additionally, when the project began integrating AI-driven customer interactions, I emphasized the importance of transparency, ensuring users were informed when they were interacting with an AI rather than a human representative.
                </div>
            
                <div class="des">
                    <strong>Result (R):</strong><br>
                    My recommendations led to a more ethically sound data collection process. The final design of the form requested only essential customer information, and the addition of the privacy policy increased transparency. These changes ensured that the website followed data privacy laws and helped build trust with customers. However, I realized that providing regular team training on data ethics would have improved our collective approach to these issues.

                <div class="des">
                    <strong>Learning (L):</strong><br>
                    This experience reinforced the importance of ethical accountability in technology. It highlighted the delicate balance between collecting data for business needs and respecting users' privacy rights. Moving forward, I am committed to being proactive in addressing ethical dilemmas in my work, whether related to data privacy, AI use, or security concerns. I’ve learned that creating a culture of responsibility within teams is essential to ensure that ethical considerations are integrated into every aspect of ICT development.
